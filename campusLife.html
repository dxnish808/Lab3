    <h1>Campus Life</h1>
    <nav>
        <p>Campus life is a vibrant mix of learning, friendships, and unforgettable memories. Vacations offer a refreshing break from studies, allowing us to explore new places with friends. Celebrations like graduation day and university festivals bring everyone together, filling the air with excitement and unity. Festivals such as Diwali and Christmas are celebrated with enthusiasm, as friends from diverse backgrounds share their traditions, creating a unique cultural blend. Weekend hangouts at local caf√©s or movie nights in dorms provide a much-needed escape, strengthening bonds. Each event and gathering adds color to university life, making it a truly unforgettable journey.</p>
